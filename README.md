# Hi there! 👋

My name is **Marcel Bittrich** *(he/him)* and I am a :space_invader: game developer with a previous career in 🚗 automotive and ✈️ aeronautics engineering. 
Due to my passion for video games I pursued this career change and here you can see my latest projects.

- :video_game: I made an "Asteroids" like game written in C++ with SDL2 that you can play
- :rocket: Next will be my own two months Unreal project 
- 💻 I completed Udemy courses about UE5 C++ game and multiplayer development and implement my learning into my projects
- :books: I’m also learning C++ and game development with the help of "C++ Primer" and "Game Engine Architecture"

If you like to reach me feel free to say hi here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-bittrich).
